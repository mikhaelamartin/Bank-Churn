False positives are people who we think are going to attrite but don't actually attrite. False negatives are people who we think are going to stay, but acutally levae. We care more about minimizing this group because they are more costly. WE want Recall for people who churn to be high. This means we want a large proportion of people who are positive are properly classified as positive and small portion classified as negative."
